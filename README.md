# In-browser Internet Radio client proof of concept

Some simple JS to talk to an Internet Radio with a Frontier Silicon API.

Run index.html in your browser.

Edit radio.js for your radio's IP address, or hack your hosts file and point 'revo' to the IP address (I have a Revo SuperConnect).

#### 23.04.25 Added upgraded UI using [Materialize Library](https://materializeweb.com/)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The webpage must be accessed by http **NOT** https because the fsapi is being served over http
